# timestamp-microservice
FCC API project Timestamp Microservice

User Stories:
1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016).

2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.

3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
Example Usage:
https://season-jasmine.glitch.me//June 22, 2017 
https://season-jasmine.glitch.me//1498089600
Example Output:
{ unix: 1498089600, natural: "June 22, 2017" }
